Open-translation (for lack of a better name)

The idea of this code is to provide web-site visitors the 
ability to help provide text translations for a web-site.

Using JS, a developer can provide a context for users to provide 
translations for text on a website. For text that already has 
translation submissions, the user will be able to vote up or down.

These translations submissions can be viewed by a web-site 
administrator who can then use that information to update locale 
entries.

If you are looking to provide localization for a web-site, an 
introductory article that may be helpful is as follows:
