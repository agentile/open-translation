Open-translation (for lack of a better name)

The idea of this code is to provide web-site visitors the 
ability to help provide text translations for a web-site.

Using JS, when a user highlight a portion of text, an option
will be available to provide a translation for select text.
For selected text that already have translation submissions, 
the user will be able to vote up or down (This is how facebook 
provided accurate translations while pushing the work off to 
their user base). 

These translations submissions can be viewed by a web-site 
administrator which can then be used to update locale entries.
